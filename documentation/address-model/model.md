# Address model for EnMasse

This document defines the EnMasse address model. This involves the types of address spaces, the
types of addresses within each address space, and the available plans.

## Definitions

### Address space

An Address Space is a group of addresses that can be accessed through a single connection (per
protocol). This means that clients connected to the endpoints of an address space may send or receive messages to any address
it is _authorized_ to send or receive messages to within that address space. An address space may
support multiple protocols, which is defined by the address space type.

TODO: How should multiple protocols be handled? How does it relate to plans?

### Address

An Address is part of an Address Space, and represents a destination used for sending and receiving
messages. An address has a type, which defines the semantics of sending and receiving messages
to/from that address. Each address may also support a set of properties that may change the
semantics and/or control who may interact with that address.

TODO: Perhaps a more precise definition?

### Plans

Both Address Spaces and Addresses may be restricted by a plan, which translates to a
limit on resource usage across multiple dimensions. The set of plans may be extended in the future,
and the constraints imposed by a plan within an address space may change as operational experience
is gained.

#### Address Space Plans

Each Address Space has plan that restricts the aggregated resource usage within an address space. Each address space type may translate the plan into a set of restrictions such as 'may scale up to 5 routers' or 'may create up to 10 addresses'. These restrictions are documented within each address space.

#### Address Plans

The usage of each address is also constrained by a plan. Each address type maybe translate the plan into a set of restrictions such as 'up to 5 consumers' or 'up to 100 messages/hour'. The restrictions of a plan is documented within each address type.

## Address spaces

The currently supported address spaces are:

   * standard

### Standard address space

The `standard` address space is the default in EnMasse, and consists of an AMQP router network in
combination with attachable 'storage units'. The implementation of a storage unit is hidden from
the client and the routers with a well defined API. This address space type is appropriate when you
have many connections and addresses, but requires message ordering to be enforced by clients. 

Clients connect and send/receive messages in this address space using the [AMQP](http://www.amqp.org) or [MQTT](http://www.mqtt.org) protocols. See [MQTT over AMQP](../mqtt-over-amqp) for how MQTT and AMQP addresses co-exists in this address space.

TODO: This reflects the status quo, but how should multiple protocols actually be surfaced?

#### Address types

The standard address space supports 4 address types:

   * queue
   * topic
   * anycast
   * broadcast

TODO: Document plan restrictions

##### Queue

The `queue` address type is a store-and-forward queue. This address type is appropriate for
implementing a distributed work queue, handling traffic bursts and other usecases where you want to
decouple the producer and consumer. A queue may be sharded across multiple storage units, in which case
message order is no longer guaranted.

##### Topic

The `topic` address type supports the publish-subscribe messaging pattern where you have 1..N
producers and 1..M consumers. Each message published to a topic address is forwarded to all
subscribers for that address. A subscriber may also be durable, in which case messages are kept
until the subscriber has acknowledged them.

##### Anycast

The `anycast` address type is a scalable 'direct' address for sending messages to one consumer. Messages sent to an `anycast` address is
not stored but forwarded directly to the consumer. This makes this address type ideal for
request-reply (RPC) uses or even work distribution. This is the cheapest address type as it doesn't
require any persistence.

##### Broadcast

The `broadcast` address type is a scalable 'direct' address for sending messages to multiple
consumers. Messages sent to a `broadcast` address are forwarded to all consumers receiving on that
address. It is important to note that only pre-settled messages can be sent to broadcast addresses,
as message acknowledgements from consumers are not propagated to producers.
