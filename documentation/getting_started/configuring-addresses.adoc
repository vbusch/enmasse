==== Address types

{ProductName} is configured with a set of addresses that you can use for
messages. Currently, {ProductName} supports 4 different address types:

* Brokered queues
* Brokered topics (pub/sub)
* Direct anycast addresses
* Direct broadcast addresses

See the link:common/address-model.adoc[address model] for details.
{ProductName} also comes with a console that you can use for managing
addresses. You can get the console URL by running the following command:

[subs=attributes+,options="nowrap"]
....
echo "http://$({OcGetRoute} console)"
....

You can also deploy the addressing config using the address controller
API. See the link:common/configuring-using-restapi.adoc[restapi documentation] for details on the
resources consumed by the API. Here is an example config with all 4 variants that you can save to `addresses.json`:

[subs=attributes+,options="nowrap"]
....
{
  "apiVersion": "enmasse.io/v1",
  "kind": "AddressList",
  "items": [
    {
      "metadata": {
        "name": "myqueue"
      },
      "spec": {
        "type": "queue"
      }
    },
    {
      "metadata": {
        "name": "mytopic"
      },
      "spec": {
        "type": "topic"
      }
    },
    {
      "metadata": {
        "name": "myanycast"
      },
      "spec": {
        "type": "anycast"
      }
    },
    {
      "metadata": {
        "name": "mymulticast"
      },
      "spec": {
        "type": "multicast"
      }
    }
  ]
}
....

To deploy this configuration, you must currently use a http client like curl:

[subs=attributes+,options="nowrap"]
....
curl -X POST -H "content-type: application/json" --data-binary @addresses.json http://$({OcGetRoute} restapi)/v1/addresses/default
....

This will connect to the address controller REST API and deploy the address config.
